# odilia-common

Common algorithms and data structures shared by multiple Odilia crates.

Part of the [Odilia screen reader project](https://odilia.app).

## Design

Among other things, this crate is designed for use in the addon API, as well as for internal data types, structures and
algorithms that need to be shared between multiple components of Odilia.

## Contributing

This is a very young project, we appreciate any and all contributions! However, please be aware there is a very llarge
learning curve to helping with this project, particularly due to the lack of documentation, or **complete**
documentation, of many of the libraries and technologies that comprise the Linux accessibility stack. For this reason,
we are currently focused on learning as much as we can, and writing code to take advantage of it, and we don't have lots
of time to mentor new contributors or review pull requests.

Once the ground-work has been layed, accepting contributions should get much easier. We are greatful for your
cooperation in this regard!
